# SalaryPlot

### Backround
One of my first projects with my employer was to suport managment during the faculty contract negotiation.  I was tasked with collecting faculty salary information from similar universities and packaging this information in an easy to interpret format.

### My Approach
I choose to present the data as a floating bar chart.  The floating bars represent the faculty salary range at each institution.  To easily indicate which bar was my institution, I filled it's bar with one of the school colours. The remainder of the bars were filled with a subdued grey.  To allow for easy comparison between my institution and its comparators, I added a horizontal bar with same vertical range and fill colour as my institution.   The horizontal  with the same salary range as my institution that flowed accros the chart.     I believe this approach allows viewers to make comparisons quickly and accurately  I wanted to provide was a easy to read plot that allowed quick comparisons between NSCAD and comparitors.  I choose to utilize a floating bar chart since this would highlight both the minimum and maximum values.
