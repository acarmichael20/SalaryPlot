### Backround
One of my first projects with my employer was to suport managment during the faculty contract negotiation.  I was tasked with collecting faculty salary information from similar universities and packaging this information in an easy to interpret format.

### My Approach
I choose to present the data as a floating bar chart. The floating bars represent the faculty salary range at each institution. To easily indicate which bar was my institution, I filled the bar with one of the school colours. The remainder of the bars were filled with a light grey. To allow for easy comparison between my institution and its comparators, I extended my institutions bar horizontally across the other universities and increased the transparency of the added width.  

This approach does not distract the viewer with the distraction of the dollar amounts, though these details could be added though the use of mouse hover detail, it simply highlights how the institution of interest stacks up relative to local comparators.
